<h1>Jared Hirsch's digital lilypad</h1>
<img src="index_files/coding.gif">

<p>Hey there. I work for Mozilla, make music and math, take photos, read books, and span time with my awesomely talented <a href="https://www.katiecollinsart.com">wife</a>.

<p>I'm @6a68 on twitter and github, but jaredhirsch on Linkedin. I very rarely write about tech-related things at https://6a68.net. And I might, someday, do more with this website 🤷‍♂️
